#### Introduction 

- The Andes have a lot of plants
- We don't know much about their reproductive strategies and interactions with pollinators
- It's good to know this because the evolution of pollination syndromes is in many clades, closely linked to speciation. 
- Recently, Centropogon has been of interest because it is young and speciose
- Summarise what we know about Centropogon evolution/speciation 
  - Figure 1. Elevational distribution.
- In this paper we detail the development and pollination of Centropogon granulosus inhabiting a cloud forest in southeastern Peru. 

\newpage

#### Methods

- Dates in the field. 
- Pollination exclusion experiment [see Figure 1 in @sun_2017]. How many Centropogon sampled (n=???)
- camera traps (number of traps, number of Centropogon)
- Using camera trap data to manually record Sicklebills

\newpage

#### Results: 
  - Figure 2. Developmental stages of Centropogon. 
  - Figure 3. Pollination by Sicklebills
  - Discuss things that live in or around the flowers (ants (cite Stein and LauraLago), mites (cite MacGregor), arachnids)
