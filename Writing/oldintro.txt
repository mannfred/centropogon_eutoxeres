&emsp;&emsp; The Andes comprise the highest mountains in the western hemisphere and are one of the most biodiverse regions on Earth [@myers_2000; @hoorn_2018]. With a mean elevation of 4000 m, the Andes encompass myriad environments including warm Amazonian rainforests, montane puna grasslands, and cool wet páramo. During Andean orogeny, numerous angiosperm clades diversified as they migrated and adapted to novel montane environments [@gentry_1982], e.g. _Costus_ [Costaceae, @kay_2005], _Lupinus_ L. [Fabaceae, @hughes_2006], bromeliads [Bromeliaceae, @givnish_2014], centropogonids [Lobelioideae, @lagomarsino_2016], epiphytic orchids [Epidendroideae, @perez_2017]. At present, ~10% of the world's angiosperm species are found within the Andes ecoregions [@joppa_2011]. 

&emsp;&emsp; Plant-pollinator co-evolution is an important biotic component of Andean radiations. In the taxa listed above, pollinator shifts are hypothesized to be a contributor, if not primary driver of diversification. As a plant species expands into a novel montane environment, floral traits may drift, evolve via pleiotropy, or adapt to a pre-existing pollinator community [@harder_2009; @smith_2016]. Subsequently, divergence in floral phenotype can be reinforced when reciprocal adaptation between the plant and pollinator promotes floral isolation [@grant_1949; @thompson_2005]. Reciprocal evolution acting as a source of divergent selection is generally framed as special case of ecological speciation [@gomez_2009; @althoff_2014], and these clades have compelling morphological and phylogenetic evidence for co-evolutionary diversification. However, other aspects of the pollination syndrome are often understudied (e.g. phenology, nectar composition, floral orientation), and direct observations of plant-pollinator interactions are missing [although this gap is gradually closing, @dellinger_2020]. 

&emsp;&emsp; In this study, we investigated whether microecological processes (i.e. biotic interactions, floral development) support the theory of pollinator-mediated diversification in the mega-diverse Andean bellflowers (Campanulaceae).  Here, we focus on a putative plant-hummingbird system that has evolved extreme curvature of the flower and bill: _Centropogon granulosus_ C.Presl and Buff-tailed Sicklebill, _Eutoxeres condamini_. The Andean bellflowers (*Centropogon* C. Presl), along with *Siphocampylus* Pohl and *Burmeistera* H.Karst & Triana form a South American clade of Campanulaceae known as the ‘centropogonids’ [@lagomarsino_2014]. The centropogonids arose in the last five million years and have diversified into over 550 species [@lagomarsino_2016]. This rapid radiation has been attributed to increased speciation rates driven by Andean uplift, and the repeated evolution of hummingbird and bat pollination [@lagomarsino_2017; @lagomarsino_2019]. The Andean clade _Centropogon_ section _Centropogon_ (McVaugh 1949) or the ‘eucentropogonids’ (38 spp., Lagomarsino et al 2014) are distinct because of their elongated, hook-shaped flower tube, and the presence of a scale made of fused hairs that serves as a lever to deposit pollen (Figure S1). Both traits are thought to be adaptations for pollination by Sicklebill hummingbirds (*Eutoxeres*): two species of large Hermits (Phaethornithinae) named for their dramatically curved bill (Figure 1). Their unique bill shape is likely an adaptation to feed from eucentropogonids and _Heliconia_ L. (Zingiberales) with similarly curved flowers. The Hermits diverged early in the evolutionary history of hummingbirds [~26 Ma, @mcguire_2014], and represent one of two major hummingbird ecotypes: the trapliners [cf. territory holders, @janzen_1971]. _Eutoxeres_ diverged 21.5 Ma, and probably co-evolved extreme curvature with _Heliconia_ subgenus _Stenochlamys_ and/or _Heliconia_ subgenus _Griggsia_  in lowland Amazonia, before the uplift of the Andes [@stein_1987; @abrahamczyk_2017; @iles_2017]. During a recent period of major Andean uplift (~5 Ma) _Centropogon_ colonized and radiated into novel montane habitat [@lagomarsino_2016], with some species presumably exadapting to Sicklebill pollination. This may have meditated the elevational expansion of Sicklebills, and explains why they are able to exist outside of the range of _Heliconia_ [@stein_1987; @abrahamczyk_2017]. At present, _Eutoxeres_ has the largest elevational range of any Hermit hummingbird &mdash; it can be found in its ancestral range, the Amazonian lowlands, as well as the foothills and mid-montane habitats of the Andes up to 3300 m [@hinkelmann_2020]. However, the physiological pre-adaptations that allowed Sicklebills to expand, and not other Hermits, remains unknown [@stiles_2004]. 

&emsp;&emsp; Previous work has progressively supported White-tipped Sicklebill (*Eutoxeres aquila*) as a specialized pollinator of _Centropogon_ and _Heliconia_. This hummingbird is known to be a trapliner [@stiles_1985], it pollinates the aforementioned plants [@gill_1987; @maglianesi_2015; @morrison_2020], and network analyses of plant-hummingbird communities indicate that its curved bill contributes to niche partitioning [@maglianesi_2014; @sonne_2019]. In contrast, very little is known of its congener, _E. condamini_. Thus, the goal of this study is to further test the theory of pollinator-meditated diversification in the eucentropogonids by examining the microecology [sensu @dellinger_2020] of the Andean bellflower _C. granulosus_ and Buff-tailed Sicklebill in the cloud forests of southeastern Peru. We structured our approach by 1) assessing floral trait information within the 'pollination syndrome' concept to generate hypotheses, and then 2) testing these hypotheses by analysing local patterns of co-occurrence, documenting plant-pollinator interactions, and characterizing floral development. 


<!-- While the pollination syndrome concept has proven useful in inferring pollinators from floral phenotypes [@dellinger_2020], a complete theory of pollinator-mediated plant diversification ultimately requires _in situ_ observations of visitation, and evidence of pollination. Moreover, without a dedicated focus on the organisms' natural history, it cannot be ruled out that yet-unknown floral visitors directly or indirectly interact with the pollinator. Here we aim to provide some missing fundamental natural history information on this fascinating and increasingly well-studied pollination system.  -->

In addition to morphology, phenological trait matching is important to consider. For example, in hummingbird-visited Bromeliaceae, >70% of species exhibit steady state flowering, with XXX percent visited by traplining hummingbirds. 

## Do local elevational distributions suggest Sicklebill pollination?
The distribution of putatively Sicklebill-pollinated _Centropogon_ and _Heliconia_ suggests that above ~1500 m, there are few _Heliconia_-Sicklebill interactions (Figure 1). Generally, the elevational distribution of the eucentropogonids is mid- to high-montane (Figure 1). 

Thus, we might expect hummingbird-pollinated eucentropogonids to (in general) exhibit a flowering syndrome that reflects both morphological and phenological trait-matching. Given that _E. aquilia_ is a trapliner [@stiles_1985], we expect _E. condamini_ to share the same foraging strategy and for its food plants to exhibit a flowering mode adapted accordingly (i.e. steady state).

&emsp;&emsp;  Plant-pollinator co-evolution is an important biotic component of rapid Andean radiations.  In numerous Andean plant taxa, pollinator shifts are hypothesized to be a contributor, if not primary driver of diversification [e.g. _Costus_ L. @kay_2005; _Lupinus_ L. @hughes_2006; bromeliads @givnish_2014; centropogonids @lagomarsino_2016; epiphytic orchids @perez_2017]. These predictions are generated by macroevolutionary models [e.g. BAMM, @rabosky_2014] that incorporate various lines of evidence including climate, fossil records, and phylogenetics, to quantify the relative contribution of pollinator shifts to rates of diversification. Because the most effective pollinator [@stebbinsXXX] of many Andean plants is unknown, assigning a pollination mode to a species is often achieved via the pollination syndrome concept [sensu @dellinger_2020]. In some cases, studying the pollination ecology of one species can assist in inferring the pollinators of lesser studied relatives, knowing only their floral traits. Macroevolutionary models incorporate these data with additional types of evidence to make improved predictions of the probable pollinators of species without pollinator records. In turn, these models can be validated by testing these predictions in the field via studies of pollination ecology. In this study we 'close the loop' by testing one of such predictions from a recent analysis of rapid, pollinator-mediated diversification in the Andean bellflowers (Campanulaceae). We do this by examining the pollination ecology of _Centropogon granulosus_ C.Presl and Buff-tailed Sicklebill hummingbird (*Eutoxeres condamini*).
