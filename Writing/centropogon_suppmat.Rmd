\newpage
#### Visit duration

To estimate the duration of *E. condamini* visits, we considered that the camera traps took photos in sets of five, lasting less than 3 seconds. To make a conservative estimate, we assume the five photos take 3 seconds. For any 5-photo set in which *E condamini* appears, we assume 3 seconds visitation. For example, during visitation, if *E. condamini* appears in two 5-photo sets, we assume a 2 \times 3 second (= 6 second) visit, even if the hummingbird appeared in only a subset of the 10 photos. 


#### Phenological modeling 

To model flowering phenology of _C. granulosus_, we fit the following linear model to the rate of anthesis and senescence for each inflorescence that produced at least five flowers ($n$ = 5 controls, $n$ = 5 pollinator excluded): 

$$n_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1*days + \epsilon$$

&emsp;&emsp; Where $n_i$ is the cumulative number of flowers produced on an inflorescence at $days$=$i$, $\beta_0$ is the intercept, $\beta_1$ is the flowering rate, and $\epsilon$ is the residual error. 

&emsp;&emsp; To determine if pollinator exclusion affected the total number of flowers produced, we fit the linear model:

$$n_{total} = \beta_0 + \beta_1*treatment + \epsilon$$
&emsp;&emsp; Where $\beta_0$ is the intercept, $\beta_1$ is a coefficient, and $\epsilon$ is the residual error.
