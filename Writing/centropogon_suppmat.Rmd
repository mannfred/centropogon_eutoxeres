#### Phenological modeling 

To model flowering phenology of _C. granulosus_, we fit the following linear model to the rate of anthesis and senescence for each inflorescence that produced at least five flowers ($n$ = 6 controls, $n$ = 5 pollinator excluded): 

$$n_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1*days + \epsilon$$

&emsp;&emsp; Where $n_i$ is the cumulative number of flowers produced on an inflorescence at $days$=$i$, $\beta_0$ is the intercept, $\beta_1$ is the flowering rate, and $\epsilon$ is the residual error. 

&emsp;&emsp; To determine if pollinator exclusion affected the total number of flowers produced, we fit the linear model:

$$n_{total} = \beta_0 + \beta_1*treatment + \epsilon$$
&emsp;&emsp; Where $\beta_0$ is the intercept, $\beta_1$ is a coefficient, and $\epsilon$ is the residual error. 

&emsp;&emsp; To test for differences in male/female phase duration between treatments, we fit a generalized mixed-effects model for each phase in `lme4` vXXX [XXX]:

$$n = \beta_0 + \beta_1*treatment + U_i + \epsilon$$

&emsp;&emsp; Where $n$ is the duration of the specified phase, $U_i$ is the individual specific random effect, and all other variables are as above. Cohen's standardized effects ($d$) were calculated from $t$ values and degrees of freedom using `effectsize` v.0.4.4 [@shacar_2020].
