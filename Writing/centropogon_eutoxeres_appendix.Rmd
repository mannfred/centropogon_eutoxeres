#### Further notes on methods

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

#### Visit duration

To estimate the duration of *E. condamini* visits, we considered that the camera traps took photos in sets of five, lasting less than 3 seconds. To make a conservative estimate, we assume the five photos take 3 seconds. For any 5-photo set in which *E condamini* appears, we assume 3 seconds visitation. For example, during visitation, if *E. condamini* appears in two 5-photo sets, we assume a 2 \times 3 second (= 6 second) visit, even if the hummingbird appeared in only a subset of the 10 photos. 

#### Landmarking and calculating curvature

In Figure 1 (main text) we present a graphical illustration of the range of pollination niches within the centropogonids. To compute total curvature [sensu @boehm_2022], we used the following protocol. First, images were imported into _tpsUtil_ [@rohlf_2015]. This .tps file is used by _tpsDig_ [@rohlf_2015] for landmark assignment. We then placed the following two landmarks on each flower: (A) the base of the dorsal side of the corolla tube where the petals attach to the receptacle and (B) the apex of the dorsal petal. Nine additional sliding semi-landmarks were then placed between the two landmarks, outlining the dorsal arc of the corolla tube. For the hummingbirds, the following two landmarks were placed on each bill: (C) the base of the dorsal side of the upper mandible (exposed), and (D) the apex of the bill. Nine semi-landmarks were placed between these landmarks. 

The .tps file generated by _tpsDig_ was then imported into R v.4.1.1 via `readmulti.tps()` from `geomorph` v.4.0.0 [@adams_2013]. We then fit interpolating splines to each landmark configuration, and computed total curvature using `curvr` v.0.0.1 [@boehm_2021_b].


#### Phenological modeling 

To model flowering phenology of _C. granulosus_, we fit the following linear model to the rate of anthesis and senescence for each inflorescence that produced at least five flowers ($n$ = 5 controls, $n$ = 5 pollinator excluded): 

$$n_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1*days + \epsilon$$

&emsp;&emsp; Where $n_i$ is the cumulative number of flowers produced on an inflorescence at $days$=$i$, $\beta_0$ is the intercept, $\beta_1$ is the flowering rate, and $\epsilon$ is the residual error. 

&emsp;&emsp; To determine if pollinator exclusion affected the total number of flowers produced, we fit the linear model:

$$n_{total} = \beta_0 + \beta_1*treatment + \epsilon$$
&emsp;&emsp; Where $\beta_0$ is the intercept, $\beta_1$ is a coefficient, and $\epsilon$ is the residual error.
