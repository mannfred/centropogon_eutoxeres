(1) Do local patterns of co-occurrence reflect the Centropogon-mediated expansion of Buff-tailed Sicklebill? 
(2) Is Buff-tailed Sicklebill a visitor of C. granulosus? 
(3) Does Sicklebill visitation affect the fitness of C. granulosus? 
(4) Are phenological traits in C. granulosus congruent with morphological evidence for Sicklebill pollination? 

Patterns of local occurrence stuff:

Intro: 
We structured our approach by asking (1) Do local patterns of co-occurrence reflect the _Centropogon_-mediated expansion of Buff-tailed Sicklebill?

Methods:
&emsp;&emsp; To estimate local patterns of co-occurrence, we first located putatively Sicklebill-pollinated eucentropogonid and _Heliconia_ species (subgenera _Stenochlamys_ and _Griggsia_) documented within a ~100 km radius of the field site, using the 'Geographic Search' function in Tropicos v3.2.2 [@missouri_2021]. We then queried the Global Biodiversity Information Facility [XXX] for occurrence records. Because there are limited data for these clades, we expanded the search to include adjacent regions (Madre de Dios, Puno, and northwest to Huánuco and Ucayali) while remaining outside the range of White-tipped Sicklebill (Figure XXX). Occurrence data were obtained using `rgbif` v3.3.0 [@chamberlain_2021] and validated by `scrubr` v0.3.2 [@chamberlain_2020]. Elevation was estimated from latitude-longitude data (30 m resolution) associated with the GBIF records using `rgbif::elevation()`. We used the same protocol for a genus-wide search of _Eutoxeres_ occurrences; this allowed us to check for the presence of _E. aquila_ within the study region.  For comparative purposes, we haphazardly selected four species each from the sister clades of Sicklebill-pollinated _Heliconia_ [@iles_2017] and _Centropogon_ [@lagomarsino_2014]. We also selected Green Hermit hummingbird (*Phaethornis guy*), the closest relative to _Eutoxeres_ that reliably occurs at the study site. We acquired occurrence data for these sister clades as described above. 


Results:
We located Tropicos records for six eucentropogonids, and five _Heliconia_ spp. within the Kosñipata Valley. For these 11 species, we obtained 313 GBIF records for the region of study &mdash; we also obtained 126 records of Buff-tailed Sicklebill. No observations of White-tipped Sicklebill were returned. We used these records to estimate the elevational distribution of Sicklebill-pollinated plants within the Kosñipata Valley. 95% of the _E. condamini_ observations occur with X to X m. 95% of the plant occurrences fall within XXX m.  

Discussion:
The elevational distribution of putatively Sicklebill-pollinated _Heliconia_ and eucentropoginids is largely congruent. Cite Merkord for BTS distributions and compare to upper Centropogon dist. 


At the genus level, _Centropogon_ spp. occur at higher elevations than
