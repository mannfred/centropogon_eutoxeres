What do hummingbirds’ feet have to do with their bills? We gathered records of 66 hummingbird species known to cling by their feet to feed legitimately as pollinators or illegitimately as nectar-robbers. We compared key features and the functional morphology of the bills and feet of these “clingers” to 144 presumed “non-clinger” species. Once the confounding effects of body size, phylogenetic signal, and elevation above sea level and are filtered out statistically, hummingbirds display a surprising, but functionally interpretable tradeoff. Short-billed species have repeatedly and independently evolved exceptionally long hallux claws—more than 20 times, with instances in every major clade. Their biomechanically enhanced feet allow them to save energy by clinging to feed legitimately on short-corolla flowers and by stealing nectar from long-corolla flowers, particularly at high elevations, where hovering is especially costly.
